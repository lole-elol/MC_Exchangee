# MC_Exchange
McExchange brings trading to minecraft, by bringing together the powers of AWS Lambda and custom minecraft servers.

## Setup
The project consists of two parts, the server plugin, located in `minecraft/python-plugins` and the aws lambda function, which can be found in `aws`.
Both need to be set up, instructions for that are in the individual `README.md(s)`.

## Usage
Once the individual parts have been set up, you can just connect to the server with minecraft - Ideally with friends, It's hard to make money with no one to rip off.
All the in-game commands can be accessed via the console, just type in `/exchange` and get started!


## Outlook & Future Extensions 
- Allow for advanced trading types like stop losses, market & limit orders.
- Enable trading with villagers
- Plug & play trading & matching logic to other games
